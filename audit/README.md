# audit

The Y2K economic audit is broken into two separate sections:

1. Oracle manipulation analysis in [./oracle-manipulation.md](./oracle-manipulation.md)
2. Insurance pricing mechanism analysis in [./insurance-pricing.md](./insurance-pricing.md)

The first section deals with cost of attack calculations for manipulating the underlying Curve MIM
pool to intentionally trigger depeg events on Y2K.

The second section focuses on the current insurance pricing mechanisms implemented by the protocol.
It dives deeper into ways to improve pricing to mitigate the issues mentioned.
